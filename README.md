**JavaScript** | **Unit Tests** | **Functions** | **JSON** | **Loops**

## What is does:

- Takes a word that was pre-determined, from English to Pig-Latin
- If the word starts with a vowel (a,e,i,o,u), adds -yay to the end of it.
- If the word starts with a consonant or multiple consonants, adds a hyphen to the end of the word, takes the consonants and moves them after the hyphen adding ay.
- If there is a sentence, takes each word individually and translates them appropriately.
