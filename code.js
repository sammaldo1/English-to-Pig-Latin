    encodeVowelWord()

    Encode words that begin with a vowel sound from english to pig latin
    For words that begin with vowel sounds, one just adds "yay" to the end.

    For example:
        "eat" becomes "eat-yay"
        "omelet" becomes "omelet-yay" 
*/
function encodeVowelWord(word) {
  return ""; // replace this!
}

/*  --------------------------------------------------------
    encodeConsonantWord()

    Encode words that begin with a consonant sound from english to pig latin.
    For words that begin with consonant sounds, all letters before the initial vowel 
    are placed at the end of the word sequence, preceded by a hyphen "-". Then, "ay" is added. 
    
    For example:
        "latin" becomes "atin-lay"
        "cheers" becomes "eers-chay"

/*  --------------------------------------------------------
    encodeWord()

    Decide whether a given word starts with a vowel sound or consonant sound,
    and call encodeVowelWord(word) or encodeConsonantWord(word) when relevant.

    For example:
        "eat" becomes "eatyay" because it starts with a vowel "e"
        "omelet" becomes "omeletyay" because it starts with a vowel "o"
        "latin" becomes "atin-lay" because it starts with a consonant "l""
        "cheers" becomes "eers-chay" because it starts with a consonant cluster "ch"
        "you" becomes "ou-yay" because it starts with a consonant "y"

function encodeWord(word) {
  return ""; // replace this!
